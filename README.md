# ESP32 WiFi & AWS IoT Application Development

## About This Repository
This repository contains my learning journey and project work from the Udemy course **"IoT Application Development with the ESP32 using the ESP-IDF."** This course is focused on building a feature-rich WiFi-based application using the **ESP32** and **Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF)** while integrating cloud services with **AWS IoT Core** using the **MQTT protocol**.

## What I'm Learning
- Developing WiFi-based applications on the **ESP32** using the **ESP-IDF**.
- Utilizing **FreeRTOS** for task management and inter-task communication.
- Configuring **AWS IoT Core** on the ESP32 and using **MQTT** to publish/subscribe messages.
- Building a **web server** for data visualization and device control.
- Implementing **Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates**.
- Using **Non-Volatile Storage (NVS)** to save and load WiFi credentials.
- Working with **ESP-IDF Components & Sensors Library** to integrate peripherals like **DHT22 sensors** and **RGB LEDs**.
- Leveraging **semaphores, message queues, and event groups** for efficient system operation.

## Hardware Used
- **ESP32 DevKit**
- **DHT22 Sensor** (for temperature and humidity data)
- **RGB LED** (for status indication)
- **Breadboard & Jumper Wires**

## Software & Tools
- **ESP-IDF Eclipse Plugin (Espressif IDE)**
- **Google Chrome** (for testing web-based functionality)
- **AWS IoT Core** (for cloud connectivity)

## Why I'm Taking This Course
I am deeply passionate about **embedded systems** and want to master ESP32 development using the **ESP-IDF** rather than relying on Arduino. This course helps me build a **modular, scalable, and professional** IoT application while sharpening my **C programming** and **real-time system** skills.

## Future Plans
I plan to use the knowledge gained from this course to work on real-world **embedded IoT projects**, improve my **firmware development skills**, and contribute to **open-source ESP32 projects**.
